      "I got some great deals on Tufo clincher tyres which I find roll better than my contis and have a more accurate rim size, easy to get on and off and not as expensive even though they weigh the same and have the same vectran technology.  Excellent service, highly recommended. Ive got my eye on a set of their wheels which look fantastic.",

      "I've been running some NR6 carbon wheels for a few weeks now, and the difference made over high quality alloy rims is huge. Shaving minutes off my commute. They add stunning looks and comfort as well as great rolling resistance (or lack of). Excellent support aswell with any questions such as compatibility of tyres. A great upgrade to a any bike.",
