      "The NR6 27,5- and 29-inch AM wheels have been designed to be just as good going downhill taking the bumps and jumps in their stride as they perform and soaking up the long miles of a XC course. The wheels have been tested by members of the RAF Enduro team, proving these wheels can perform just as good in a race environment as they can having fun at your local bike park.",
